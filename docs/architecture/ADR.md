# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This document tracks important architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them.

## ADR-001: Adopt Domain-Driven Design

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

The ESDC Frontend was growing in complexity with business logic scattered across components. We needed a clear architectural pattern to:

- Organize code better
- Make the codebase more maintainable
- Enable easier testing
- Support future growth
- Separate business logic from UI

### Decision

Adopt Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with strict layered architecture:

- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and domain model
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External integrations and data access
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Business logic is testable in isolation
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ Scalable architecture
- ✅ Domain-focused development
- ✅ Reusable business logic

#### Negative

- ⚠️ Learning curve for team members
- ⚠️ More files and structure
- ⚠️ Initial setup overhead
- ⚠️ Requires discipline to maintain

#### Neutral

- 📝 Need comprehensive documentation
- 📝 Requires code review enforcement
- 📝 Team training needed

## ADR-002: ApplicationService Facade Pattern

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

With DDD, UI components need a simple way to interact with the domain and infrastructure layers. Direct access to repositories and use cases from UI components would:

- Violate layer boundaries
- Create tight coupling
- Make refactoring difficult
- Lead to inconsistent patterns

### Decision

Create an `ApplicationService` class that acts as a facade for all UI operations:

- Single entry point for UI
- Hides complexity of use cases and repositories
- Consistent API across the application
- Easy to mock for testing

```typescript
import applicationService from '@/application/ApplicationService';

// Simple API
const result = await applicationService.getAllUsers();
const result = await applicationService.createUser(userData);
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Simple API for UI developers
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Easy to refactor internals
- ✅ Clear layer boundaries
- ✅ Single source of truth
- ✅ Easy to document

#### Negative

- ⚠️ Additional abstraction layer
- ⚠️ Potential for god object if not managed

#### Mitigation

- Keep ApplicationService as thin coordinator
- Delegate to specific use cases
- Document all methods clearly

## ADR-003: Value Objects for Domain Concepts

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Using primitive types (string, number) for domain concepts leads to:

- No validation
- Type confusion (email as string)
- Duplicated validation logic
- Weak domain model
- No encapsulation

### Decision

Create Value Objects for domain concepts:

- `Email` instead of `string`
- `Points` instead of `number`
- `Difficulty` instead of `string`
- `DateRange` instead of separate dates

```typescript
// ❌ Before
const email: string = 'user@example.com';
const points: number = 100;

// ✅ After
const email = new Email('user@example.com'); // Validates automatically
const points = new Points(100); // Cannot be negative
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Built-in validation
- ✅ Type safety
- ✅ Self-documenting code
- ✅ Encapsulated business rules
- ✅ Immutability
- ✅ Easy to test

#### Negative

- ⚠️ More classes to manage
- ⚠️ Learning curve
- ⚠️ Conversion overhead

#### Neutral

- 📝 Need conversion methods (toString, getValue)
- 📝 Require understanding of value objects

## ADR-004: Event-Driven Architecture

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Many operations have side effects:

- User creation → send welcome email
- Challenge completion → update leaderboard
- Points awarded → notify user

Coupling these side effects to main business logic leads to:

- Difficult to test
- Hard to modify
- Tight coupling
- Cannot disable side effects easily

### Decision

Implement event-driven architecture using domain events:

- Publish events for significant domain changes
- Subscribe to events for side effects
- Loose coupling between modules

```typescript
// Publish
eventBus.publish({
  eventType: 'UserCreated',
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email.toString(),
});

// Subscribe
eventBus.subscribe('UserCreated', async (event) => {
  await emailService.sendWelcome(event.userId);
});
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ Easy to add/remove side effects
- ✅ Better scalability
- ✅ Clear audit trail
- ✅ Testable in isolation

#### Negative

- ⚠️ Harder to debug (async flow)
- ⚠️ Event ordering can be tricky
- ⚠️ Need monitoring/logging

#### Mitigation

- Log all events
- Document event flow
- Add event tracing in dev mode

## ADR-005: Repository Pattern for Data Access

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Direct API calls from domain or application layer:

- Creates tight coupling
- Hard to test
- Cannot switch data sources
- Business logic depends on infrastructure

### Decision

Use Repository Pattern:

- Define interfaces in domain layer
- Implement in infrastructure layer
- Inject into use cases
- Abstract data source completely

```typescript
// Interface in domain
interface IUserRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  save(user: User): Promise<void>;
}

// Implementation in infrastructure
class ApiUserRepository implements IUserRepository {
  // API-specific implementation
}
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Loose coupling
- ✅ Easy to test (mock repositories)
- ✅ Can switch data sources
- ✅ Clear abstraction
- ✅ Domain doesn't know about API

#### Negative

- ⚠️ Additional abstraction
- ⚠️ More interfaces to maintain
- ⚠️ Need DTO transformations

#### Neutral

- 📝 Need clear interface definitions
- 📝 Repository methods should be domain-focused

## ADR-006: TypeScript Strict Mode

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

JavaScript/loose TypeScript leads to:

- Runtime errors
- Type confusion
- Hard to refactor
- Poor IDE support

### Decision

Enable TypeScript strict mode:

- `strict: true` in tsconfig
- No implicit any
- Strict null checks
- All types explicit

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Catch errors at compile time
- ✅ Better IDE support
- ✅ Self-documenting code
- ✅ Easier refactoring
- ✅ Confidence in changes

#### Negative

- ⚠️ More typing overhead
- ⚠️ Learning curve
- ⚠️ Migration effort for existing code

#### Mitigation

- Gradual migration
- Team training
- Type utilities and helpers

**Status**: ✅ Accepted  
**Date**: October 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team

### Context

Managing server state with useState/useEffect:

- Boilerplate code
- No caching
- No background refetching
- Manual loading/error states
- Duplicated logic

### Decision

Use TanStack Query (React Query) for all server state:

- Automatic caching
- Background refetching
- Optimistic updates
- Unified API

```typescript
const { data: users, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['users'],
  queryFn: () => applicationService.getAllUsers(),
});
```

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Less boilerplate
- ✅ Automatic caching
- ✅ Better UX (background refetching)
- ✅ Unified patterns
- ✅ DevTools for debugging

#### Negative

- ⚠️ Additional dependency
- ⚠️ Learning curve
- ⚠️ Need to understand caching

#### Neutral

- 📝 Need guidelines for cache keys
- 📝 Document invalidation strategies

### Context

CSS-in-JS and traditional CSS have trade-offs:

- CSS-in-JS: Runtime overhead, complex setup
- Traditional CSS: Class naming issues, no tree-shaking
- Need consistent design system
- Want utility-first approach

### Decision

Use Tailwind CSS:

- Utility-first classes
- Custom design system
- Tree-shaking built-in
- Fast development

### Consequences

#### Positive

- ✅ Fast development

- How to test
- Testing library choice
- Coverage goals

### Decision

Adopt testing pyramid:

- **Many unit tests**: Domain entities, value objects, services
- **Some integration tests**: Use cases, repositories
- **Few E2E tests**: Critical user flows

Use Vitest + Testing Library:

- Fast execution
- Good DX
- Easy mocking
- Good IDE support

### Consequences

#### Positive
