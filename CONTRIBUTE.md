# Contributers Notes

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ , I am Arun CS , i want to develop this website into something usefull , me and my friends are working when ever we get time to develop this website as fast as possible.

## Little Motivation

We Use

- React
- Typescript
- Vite
  On the frontend
  But some might not know how to work with these , i dont either, but by following a simple principle like SOLID and DDD we can make this project a great one.
  And if you dont know what it is , ask google or ChatGPT or Me . And If you have an idea it can write code for you. Git Will Keep track of all the codes you write , so in the feature , you can replace or improve the code you wrote , so you can litterally start from zero. and if you are working on a new feature , you can take as much time as you want , no one is going to rush you.

## What we think we will include in this project

- A Fully Featured Project Management And Showcasing Platform
- A Blog Platform
- A E-commerce Platform for ESDC
- A LMS Platform for ESDC
