## 🔌 Customization & Integration

### Current Implementation:
The chatbot currently uses **mock responses** (rule-based system) that work out of the box without any external API.

### To Integrate Real AI:

#### Option 1: OpenAI (ChatGPT)
```bash
npm install openai
```
See `docs/chatbot-documentation.md` for detailed setup.

#### Option 2: Google Gemini
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```
See `docs/chatbot-documentation.md` for detailed setup.

#### Option 3: Custom Backend
Update `src/services/chatbot.js` to call your backend API endpoint.

## 📝 Customization Tips

### Change Chatbot Colors:
Edit `src/styles/chatbot.css`:
```css
.chatbot-toggle {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #your-color 0%, #another-color 100%);
}
```

### Add More Responses:
Edit the `getMockResponse` function in `src/services/chatbot.js`.

### Add Quick Actions:
Edit the `quickActions` array in `src/components/Chatbot.jsx`.

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop**: Chat window in bottom-right (380px width)
- **Tablet**: Slightly smaller, still bottom-right
- **Mobile**: Full-screen chat for better UX

## 🎨 Theme Support

The chatbot automatically adapts to your app's theme:
- Light mode: Clean, bright interface
- Dark mode: Dark, comfortable interface
- Uses CSS variables for easy theming

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test the chatbot on all pages
2. Try different questions
3. Check mobile responsiveness

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Integrate Real AI**: Connect to OpenAI, Gemini, or custom AI service
2. **Add Features**:
   - Voice input/output
   - File sharing
   - Image recognition
   - Conversation history persistence
3. **Analytics**: Track popular questions and user engagement
4. **Training**: Fine-tune responses based on actual user queries
